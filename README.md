# Exam Datesheet Scheduler using Greedy Algorithm

This project is an Exam Datesheet Scheduler that uses a greedy algorithm to efficiently schedule exams within a fixed number of dates. The scheduler allows for the selection of seats, venues, and other constraints to optimize the allocation of exam slots. By prioritizing exams and minimizing conflicts, the system ensures a smooth and organized exam schedule for students and administrators.
